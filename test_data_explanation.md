# Test Data Explanation

This dataset was intentionally designed to test real-world badge-swipe behaviour:

## ✔ Clean IN/OUT cycles
Employee 1

## ✔ Missing OUT (still inside)
Employee 2

## ✔ OUT before IN (messy logs)
Employee 3

## ✔ Only IN (inside)
Employee 4

## ✔ Only OUT (never inside)
Employee 5

## ✔ Duplicate INs, missing OUTs
Employee 6

## ✔ Overnight shift
Employee 7

## ✔ Multiple cycles
Employee 8

This ensures the running-total logic is robust, accurate, and production-ready.
